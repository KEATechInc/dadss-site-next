    question: `What is the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS)
        Research Program?`,
    answer: [
      `
        The DADSS Research Program is a collaborative research effort to
        invent, test, commercialize and deploy new alcohol detection
        technologies for widespread use in commercial vehicles. The
        Program brings together the Automotive Coalition for Traffic
        Safety (ACTS), which represents the world’s leading automakers,
        and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway
        Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in one of the most
        important government and private sector partnerships in
        transportation history. Public-private partnerships like DADSS
        have led to innovations that enhance our everyday lives, such as
        the Internet, GPS and the microchip.

    question: `What is the overall goal of the Program?`,
    answer: [
      `The goal is to advance the state of alcohol detection systems by
        developing a first-of-its-kind technology that can passively
        detect when a driver is under the influence of alcohol and
        prevent a vehicle from operating. The technology is being
        designed to precisely detect and measure a driver’s blood
        alcohol concentration (BAC) and if it is at or above the legal
        limit—0.08 in most states – prevent the vehicle from moving. The
        system is designed to be fast, accurate, reliable, and
        affordable – all without affecting normal driving behavior.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `How does the technology work?`,
    answer: [
      `Two technologies are being developed: a breath system and a
          touch system. The breath system will measure alcohol in a
          passive, non-invasive way as a driver breathes normally, when in
          the driver's seat. Unlike existing breathalyzers, a forced deep
          lung sample is not required into a mouthpiece, making the system
          seamless and tamperproof. The breath system is also being
          designed to accurately and reliably distinguish between the
          driver’s breath and any passengers.`,
      `The touch system measures blood alcohol levels under the skin’s
          surface by shining an infrared-light into the fingertip or palm
          of the driver. It will be integrated into current vehicle
          controls, such as the starter button or steering wheel, and take
          multiple, accurate readings in less than a second.`,

    question: `What are the projected safety benefits of the DADSS technology?`,
    answer: [
      `Despite progress over the past three decades, drunk driving
      remains the #1 cause of fatalities on U.S. roadways, claiming
      more than 10,000 lives and costing the U.S. approximately $194
      billion every year. With support from safety advocates and the
      auto industry, Congress has recognized the Program’s life-saving
      potential and made it part of a multi-faceted national
      commitment to reduce and eliminate drunk driving.`,
      `
      A 2020 study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
    (IIHS) estimates that a quarter of U.S. road fatalities could be
    prevented and more than 9,400 lives can be saved annually if
    drivers with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above the legal
    limit—0.08 in most states – can be prevented from operating a
    vehicle.

      `The Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety (ACTS) and the
      National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are
      working together in collaborative research to develop the DADSS
      technology. ACTS is a nonprofit organization wholly funded by

      Senseair AB, a Swedish-based sensor company, is working on a
      breath system, while program engineers are working with the
      German laser technology company Sensalight Technologies on a
      touch system.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `When did this program begin and how has it evolved?`,
    answer: [
      `The DADSS Program began in 2008 and was focused on research and creation of proof-of-concept prototypes to determine which technological approaches were most promising for vehicle integration. After extensive research, it was determined that the breath system and touch system were most viable.`,
      `Since that time, the Program has focused on ensuring the technology meets strict performance specifications related to accuracy, precision and reliability, so sober drivers are not inconvenienced, and so drunk drivers are never allowed to operate the vehicle.`,
      `In 2018, the Commonwealth of Virginia announced the first trial deployment with James River Transportation (JRT) to conduct in-vehicle, on-road test trials of the technology with sober drivers in naturalistic settings. This initiative, called Driven to Protect, was expanded to Maryland in 2019. That same year, the Program expanded on-road testing to include controlled, in-vehicle tests with drinking passengers, to determine how the sensors respond to real-world conditions. Those tests continue today.`,
      `In 2021, the Program announced the first-generation system equipped with the breath technology will be made available for open licensing in fleet vehicles for the first time ever. ACTS will begin licensing the technology to interested parties and a product equipped with the breath technology will be made available in late 2021 to any existing fleet or company that wants to outfit it into their vehicles – whether it be transportation vehicles, government fleets, rental cars, transportation vehicles, trucking companies, etc. This system is designed for fleet operators implementing a zero-tolerance alcohol policy for their drivers.`,
      `Today, teams of engineers, chemists and data scientists are working to reduce the size of the sensors so they are small enough to fit into passenger vehicles, can withstand harsh environmental conditions, do not require extensive calibration and can last the entire lifetime of a vehicle. Previous transportation safety innovations like airbags have taken a minimum of 20 years to be tested and approved for the public’s use, and the DADSS Program is on track to be completed in less time.`,

    question: `What is the next step for the Program?`,
    answer: [
      ` DADSS continues to form key partnerships to test the technology
          for commercial deployment. Beginning in Virginia, through the
          Driven to Protect Initiative, breath sensors have been
          integrated into vehicles for on-road tests, allowing engineers
          to collect data from sober drivers and observe driver behavior

    question: `How is DADSS technology different from interlocks, breathalyzers
      and other alcohol detection technologies? How will it prevent
      tampering?`,
    answer: [
      `The DADSS Program is developing much more sophisticated
          technology than anything on the market today and differs from
          existing ignition interlocks and breathalyzers in three main
          ways. First, there are no large pieces of hardware or equipment
          in the vehicle cabin, making the system seamless and
          tamperproof. Second, instead of requiring a forced deep lung
          sample from the driver, the system is being designed to take
          accurate, unobtrusive readings in less than a second while the
          driver breaths normally. Third, the system will meet performance
          standards related to speed, accuracy, precision and reliability
          that are higher than any other alcohol detection technology
          available today. The DADSS technology is not designed to be a
          punitive or corrective device, but rather a consumer safety
          option, much like lane departure warning or automatic braking.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `What about existing technologies such as driver monitoring
      systems?`,
    answer: [
      `Technologies that help drivers better perform their task – like
          warning of drowsiness or nearby vehicles – have come a long way,
          but they are prominently found in newer and luxury vehicles.`,
      `While these systems can, in some driving situations, infer
          certain behavior, no technology exists or is under research with
          the same level of sophistication as the systems being developed
          by DADSS to measure and quantify precise alcohol concentrations
          in drivers and render a vehicle inoperable. This is a key
          distinction, because if we are to reach the goal of saving 9,400
          lives annually that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
          (IIHS) estimates is possible, we must put in place technology
          that stops drunk drivers from driving even one mile, which
          driver monitoring systems cannot do.`,
      `DADSS technology – measuring a driver’s precise BAC in less than
          a second – is a much more sophisticated system. To date, no
          technology has been developed that can passively and
          unobtrusively measure breath alcohol concentrations with the
          necessary high levels of precision and accuracy while fitting
          into vehicles with a seamless operation. It is a true feat of
          biomedical engineering, and unlike anything designed for
          vehicles before.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `What are the technical challenges associated with the DADSS
      technology?`,
    answer: [
      `Developing a sensor that can positively, quickly, reliably, and
          accurately measure a driver’s blood alcohol concentration –
          without inconveniencing the sober driver – has never been
          attempted before. Part of the research includes inventing
          completely new equipment that also never existed before to
          rigorously test the alcohol sensors. It also means inventing the
          test methods and protocols for making measurements in the
          part–per–billion range, the test devices for making those
          measurements, and the acceptance limits. As an added challenge,
          the sensor must be small enough to fit seamlessly into a motor
          vehicle; sensitive enough to measure ultra–low concentrations of
          alcohol; intelligent enough to distinguish between the driver
          and any passengers; and rugged enough to work every day of a
          vehicle’s 20–year life span, in all types of environmental
          conditions, and with little to no maintenance. And finally, it
          must be mass producible in automotive quantities to automotive
          quality standards.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `Will the technology be reliable?`,
    answer: [
      `A significant part of the DADSS Research Program has been the establishment of DADSS Performance Specifications related to speed, accuracy, precision and reliability. These rigorous standards are based on the Department of Defense’s technology and manufacturing readiness levels, and they are in addition to
    manufacturers’ six-sigma quality requirements, which demand that every piece of safety equipment installed in passenger vehicles as original equipment performs correctly 99.9997% of the time.
    `,
      `With this combination, the DADSS technology will be held to unprecedented standards to ensure BAC levels are measured quickly and reliably. Not even medical instruments are engineered to have such strict specifications. The DADSS Program is being overseen by a team of engineers and scientists and will be further tested in real-world operating conditions and by independent third parties before being made available to consumers.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `Will the technology be set at a limit other than 0.08%?`,
    answer: [
      `The Program was authorized and funded under strict performance
    specifications based on a blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
    level of 0.08% – the legal limit in every state except Utah.
    While the DADSS Program is aware of the developments in Utah,
    they do not affect the research being conducted, and the Program
    will continue its direction based on the national standard of
    0.08%. The exception is for underage drivers. Since no level of
    alcohol is legal for drivers under 21, parents could potentially
    have the system programmed for a zero-tolerance policy.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `What happens when a driver is over the legal limit?`,
    answer: [
      `With the alcohol detection technology, when a driver has a blood
    alcohol concentration (BAC) at or above the legal limit of
    0.08%, the vehicle will start, but not move. This allows the
    driver to remain warm (or cool) and safe in the vehicle, make a
    call for help or charge a phone. The system will reset and be
    ready for another test less than a second after each reading and
    will move only when the driver’s BAC is below the legal limit.
    The final implementation of the system will vary by automaker.
    That means the location of the sensors, the actions the sensors
    will take, and/or the driver’s interaction with the sensors will
    differ greatly and depend on the individual automaker.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `How will the technology be able to tell the difference between
    drivers and passengers?`,
    answer: [
      `The system is being designed to accurately distinguish between
    the driver and other passengers, and this is a significant part
    of the required testing. The touch technology could, for
    example, be based on a touchpoint programmed by the driver,
    similar to today’s smart phones, which could also serve as an
    anti-theft measure. The breath technology is being tested with
    sensors near the driver’s seat to best isolate the driver’s
    breath. Either system will require a retest if the person in the
    driver’s seat gets out of the seat and another person sits down.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `How is this going to stop people who are most likely to drink
    and drive?`,
    answer: [
      `The DADSS technology is designed to take the guesswork out of
    BAC measurement and give drivers the certainty they will never
    put themselves or others in danger by driving over the legal
    limit. The system can also give parents an extra layer of
    protection and additional peace of mind knowing that if their
    children have been drinking, they won’t be able to drive.`,
      `For the first time, all drivers will be able to take advantage
    of a system that is seamless and nonintrusive, representing a
    breakthrough in technology and vehicle safety. We believe that
    consumers will want to purchase the technology as a safety
    option once they learn more about its life-saving potential.`,
      `A key component of the Program is to develop consumer awareness,
    acceptance and demand, so that once a product is made available,
    there is sufficient demand. In focus groups, surveys, and
    through demonstrations at in-person events, we know that
    consumers – including those who have a history of drinking and
    driving – already have a very positive opinion of the
    technology.`,
    ],

  {
    question: `Will DADSS technology be installed in every new car and truck?`,
    answer: [
      `The Program was authorized and funded as a research program to
    advance the state of alcohol detection technology, and Congress
    did not mandate the use of any technology in the authorization.
    The Program’s responsibility is to provide a working product,
    and when the technology is finalized, it will be made available
    to any vehicle manufacturer. Because each car is different, each
    manufacturer will decide how to integrate the technology into
    their vehicles in their own unique way.`,

    question: `Will DADSS technology add to the price of a new vehicle?`,

      `Possibly. The technology may be an additional cost for those who
    choose to purchase it as a safety option for their vehicle.
    While the exact cost per vehicle has not yet been established,
    it will be in line with other voluntary safety systems like
    automatic braking or lane departure warning. As with any new

    lower the price will be.`,

    principles to protect customer data from being accessed by
    unauthorized parties, and DADSS technology will be no different.

    question: `Will the system test for drugs such as marijuana?`,
    answer: [
      `Currently, the sole focus of the Program is developing a system
    that detects a driver’s precise blood alcohol concentration.
    However, a similar system could be developed that might detect
    when drivers are under the influence of THC, but the development
    of such a system would present additional challenges beyond
    those faced by an alcohol detection technology. For example,
    drugs like marijuana linger in the system longer than alcohol,
    and researchers have not yet determined where the legal limit
    should be set. These challenges, and more, face researchers as
    they look at the different types of drugs that could affect safe
    driving behavior, whether over- the-counter, prescription or
    illegal.`,
      `With additional research, the spectroscopy technique we are
    using for alcohol could be adapted for THC, using information we
    have collected from the cutting-edge laser technology being used
    in the DADSS Program. For now, Program leaders are focused
    solely on developing a system that detects a driver’s precise
    blood alcohol concentration.`,

    evolutions in vehicle technology and safety, but they are still
    in the early stages of development, while the DADSS technology
    is expected to become commercially available in the next few
    years. While it may be technically possible to have a
    self-driving vehicle in the next decade, early models are still
    likely to rely heavily on the ability of an unimpaired driver to
    take control of the wheel as a precaution.`,
